            <div class="testimony-title">BUSINESS BREAKTHROUGH & NO MORE SORROW!</div>
            <div class="testimony-testifier">Testifier: Charles, O</div>
            <div class="testimony-content">I came here last year in tears, jobless, battered and beaten by poverty.
              During the service, the Bishop called on those who wanted to give their lives to Christ, so Christ could
              take over their problems. He said, 'If you surrender your life to Jesus and start living right, God will
              give you a change of story.' These words touched me! So, I came out and gave my life wholly to Christ. I
              decided to live right and key into God's Word from Bishop's mouth. Meanwhile, I was jobless. By Friday,
              God gave me an opportunity to fund a business. I met a friend of mine, who gave me double the amount
              needed for the business! Also, he told me he has a project for me funded by the Federal Government.

              As I shared the business idea with my partners, they funded it. It was a great opportunity for me, because
              God turned around my situation, just by my coming to this church! God turned my sorrow into Joy!</div>

            <div class="testimony-testifier">Testifier: Deacon and Deaconess Louis Obidalu</div>
            <div class="testimony-content">After the birth of our first daughter, my wife and I trusted God for another
              one. However, conception became an issue of concern, and for five years, we had several miscarriages. We
              prayed, but the situation remained the same. In 2020, when the Church Planting Project was flagged off, I
              opened my rented apartment as worship center. I became more dedicated to serving God; I bought some seats
              for the church and believed that the Ark, which is God's presence, would reflect the order of
              breakthroughs encountered by Obedidum in my life. Also, with prayers and counselling from the Resident
              Pastor, I believed that God would turn my sorrows into joy. Lo, and behold, my wife got pregnant, and on
              22nd July, 2021, she delivered a bouncing baby girl. I return all the glory to God!</div>

            <div class="testimony-content">“On the third day of Shiloh 2012, the Bishop instructed us to write our
              expectations from God behind our Bibles. I wrote that I desired a change of genotype from 'SS' to 'AA' for
              my son.
              The next day, I attended the Healing School and thereafter, I took my son for a genotype test. Lo and
              behold, when I received the result, his genotype had changed from 'SS' to 'AA'. To God be all the glory!”

            <div class="testimony-content">I have been married for 18 years and was not able to conceive. Doctors said
              that everything was normal and nothing was wrong with me, and I was living under serious oppression coming
              both from my family and my in law, telling me to go to meet with traditional practitioner for solution,
              but I refused. I kept on reminding them that Christians do not attend native doctor’s houses.
              When Wonder Double Agenda was announced with 7 weeks of harvest of souls, I engaged fully in praying for
              the lost, reaching out to them and bringing them to church.
              God surprised me at the time I did not expect, I conceived after 15 years of waiting. I thank the God of
              Wonder Double for visiting me.</div>

                in sound health).</i></div>
            <div class="testimony-content">I am a medical doctor from South Africa. I was scheduled for a heart
              operation on Monday, December 5, 2011. The doctors said my chances of survival was 50-50. Doctors in the
              Academy Hospitals where I work, told me to cancel my journey to Shiloh and go for the operation. That
              notwithstanding, I came for 2011 and stayed on ground all through. The doctors and professors said, ‘You
              cannot be inside the airplane because you will die. You can’t make it in your condition.’ I told them, I
              was going for restoration and healing.
              My pastors and delegate colleagues were not aware that my heart valves were not working properly. My blood
              pressure since 2005 was 220/120, and I was on medication.
              I went to the Healing School and after the message, we were asked to go for a test. A doctor colleague of
              mine took me to the cardiologist. The result said my blood pressure had dropped to 120/70, and the four
              valves were pumping and working.</div>

            <div class="testimony-content">I was afflicted with a 15 years old breast tumor with pains. When the doctors
              examined it after several test, they concluded that it was a cancer and the only way out, they told me,
              was to cut off the affected breast. While I was seriously thinking about this alternative, I decided to
              attend Shiloh.
              At Shiloh, When Bishop told us to put our right hand on the afflicted part of our body, I did so. Lo and
              behold, immediately after that, the tumor in my breast disappeared miraculously. I am totally healed! I
              thank the God of Shiloh</div>

            <div class="testimony-title">Triplets After 20 Years Of Waiting!</div>
            <div class="testimony-testifier">Testifier: Mrs. Bodurin, O.</div>
            <div class="testimony-content">My husband and I got married 20 years ago as Christians. Since then, we had
              been believing God for the fruit of the womb. We went to hospitals to know what was really wrong, and for
              treatment. After running so many tests, the results showed that there was nothing wrong with my husband or
              me. The doctors, who could not locate the cause of our barrenness, were all confused! My husband and I did
              not allow that to worry us, because we have a God that can do all things! Some of our family members
              started getting worried. They suggested to us what to do, and where else to go. But we kept on holding
              unto our God. Meanwhile, I had not been pregnant before.
              In 2007, my husband and I came to Canaan Land for Shiloh. We came with high expectations. During the
              service, I made a vow unto God that if He should give us fruit of the womb, we would come back to Canaan
              Land to give Him the glory.
              In November 2010, I got pregnant for the first time in my life! When the pregnancy was five months, the
              devil launched his attack, but he failed. All through the pregnancy period, God’s protective arm was upon
              me and the triplets in the womb. In June 2011, I was delivered of these triplets – two boys and a girl! We
              thank God for visiting us in a very strange way!</div>

            <div class="testimony-testifier">Testifier: Banjo Debo</div>
            <div class="testimony-content">I want to thank God for restoring me back to the faith. I gave my life to
              Christ so many years ago, but along the way I stopped coming to church. I was not serious with God then
              everything became very tough. Towards the end of this year, I decided to settle down with God and be
              serious about my walk with Him. So, I rededicated my life to Christ and surrendered my life to Him
              completely. I began to obey all the instructions passed down by the Apostle over this commission. I linked
              up daily with Covenant hour of prayer. I began to be more faithful in my tithes and offerings. I gave to
              the poor like never before. Then I began to see positive changes in my life. God granted almost all my
              heart desires, Lack and want have become things of the past and I have good health. Since I came back from
              Shiloh the constant headache I used to have has gone forever. I have not gone to hospital since then. My
              farms which were not doing well began to produce well. My colleagues who used to look down on me before at
              work now give me respect and hold me in high esteem. My house project which I have abandoned for 4 years
              has taken off and now to the roofing level. I give God all the praise. </div>

            <div class="testimony-testifier">Testifier: Adelaja O.</div>
            <div class="testimony-content">I have faced marital challenges for several years, we got married in 2001 I
              had a stillbirth in 2002, & when I didn't conceive till 2004, I faced terrible challenges from my in laws,
              then my husband went away with strange woman, who used many mediums to harm me and send me out of my
              matrimonial home, but in 2008, I came to Shiloh and joined this commission because I saw Papa in my dream
              rescuing my marriage. But this year, I decided to attend breaking generational curses classes, because I
              remember the same thing happened to my mother. My husband issued a divorce and I ran to Canaanland. I met
              Bishop and He said it shall be to my favour. I involved in sharing of fliers & winning souls, forgetting
              my challenges. The final trial was slated for January 2019, After I attended the breaking generational
              curses classes at Shiloh 2018, I began to praise God as instructed waiting for my miraculous restoration,
              just 3 days ago after midnight praise, I hit my Shiloh mantle on the four corners of my bed calling my
              husband back home. Then in the morning, the lawyer called very early that I should meet my husband for
              reconciliation. To the glory of God, we are now settled today, and case withdrawn. This is what could not
              be settled for over 13 years, the God of Shiloh did it, I give Him all the glory. </div>

            <div class="testimony-testifier">Testifier: Olutosin Ikpehae</div>
            <div class="testimony-content">I join this Commission in 2007 when I married a member of this Church.
              Meanwhile, I was diagnosed with hormonal imbalance and polycystic ovary (a condition in which a woman's
              levels of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone are out of balance, and that could lead to ovarian
              cysts).
              In 2012, Bishop Oyedepo prayed for me but at that time, my faith was an irresponsible faith. However, in
              2013, my faith came alive when I realized the amount of money spent on me after visiting five hospitals to
              no avail. Thereafter, my husband and I attended Shiloh 2013 fasting.
              We also attended the Fathers and Mothers of Nations specialized session where Pastor David Oyedepo (Jnr.)
              ministered from Acts 26:8. He then instructed us to spread out baby items and write the names of our
              babies. Immediately, I wrote the names of two babies –a boy and a girl. Furthermore, when Shiloh sacrifice
              was announced, I gave all my gold jewelries and my husband gave half of what was in his bank account.
              Miraculously, two weeks after that Shiloh, I was confirmed pregnant. When I got to the hospital, the
              professor there said that it was medically impossible for me to be pregnant because I don’t menstruate or
              ovulate.
              On September 24, 2014, my baby boy – Osemuime was born. Amazingly, when he was a year old, I got pregnant
              again while ‘on the go’ for Jesus, without menstruating or ovulating. Before now, I asked God for two
              babies; today, I have the second one –Tamara Esther. I give all the glory to the God of Shiloh!</div>

              was in coma for four months and because of the bill, my family left me at the hospital. However, a lady
              came to my ward, and she told me about Shiloh. One night, I cried and called on the God of Bishop David
              Oyedepo, the God of Shiloh to heal me and if He does, I would appear in that Shiloh to show forth Is
              praise and heard and healed me. Three days later, a man that I did not know before came and said God told
              him to come help someone. Lo and behold, my bill that was half a million was supernaturally paid. Now, I
              am healed, and my debt had been settled. I return all the glory to God!</div>

            <div class="testimony-content">I had total thyroidectomy surgery on Oct 15th, 2019, as a result of a
              swelling on my neck that comes with severe pain which has also affected my voice. Further examination of
              what was brought out from my neck during the surgery shows it was thyroid cancer. I was referred to
              National hospital Abuja for further examinations and therapy. Apart from the thyroid issues, I've also
              been suffering from stomach ulcer/ gastritis and abdominal discomfort for years to the extent that the
              drugs no longer work for me. I was scheduled for next appointment by Jan with the results of the text. I
              told myself that all these harassment on my health will end at Shiloh 2019. I came to Shiloh 2019 with
              great expectations and lo and behold my expectation was never cut shut. In one of the encounter nights,
              when Papa asked us to write just 3 things that we want God to do for us. It was the major issue I wrote
              there. That encounter night Papa declared that as the Lord liveth that that night will be the end of such
              issues in our lives. I believed the prophetic declarations by Gods servants.
              On getting home after the Shiloh departure, when I looked at myself at the mirror, I discovered the
              swelling is no more there. I had to call my sister to show her too. I was full of joy. Thank you, the God
              of Bishop David Oyedepo, for confirming the words of your servant in my life. To God alone be all the

              set in fully. I distributed my properties to different houses both in Lagos and Ota. I roamed about from
              one person’s house to another just to lay my head for the night. People rejected me, threw me out of
              their houses, both families and friends, was mocked by many, I did not relent, I kept on serving GOD
              faithfully. This battle was on for 3 years, I also engaged faithfully praying kingdom advancement prayers
              and reaching out to souls as instructed, believing every word of GOD, every prophetic declaration coming
              from this altar with faith. Keyed into other people’s turn around testimonies and then GOD OF ALL
              POSSIBILITIES showed up. He gave me a contract which I was able to redeem all my past 3 Shiloh sacrifices.
              Immediately after paying those accumulated Shiloh sacrifices GOD settled me and open doors for me, my
              accommodation issues and other lingering problems around me were solved. GOD did not only give me any how
              accommodation, but a classy and glorious one in a classy environment and estate. GOD placed me in an
              estate where one has to go through tight protocols before gaining entrance. I’ve come to pay my vow, to
              return all the glory to the GOD of my father, Bishop David Oyedepo.</div>
