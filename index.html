      <h1>Jesus Loves You ❤️</h1>

      <section class="message">
        <p>Dear Friend,</p>
        <p>You are loved more deeply than you can imagine. God created you with a purpose and longs to have a
          relationship with you. His love is unconditional and eternal, no matter who you are or where you come from.
        </p>

        <p>Jesus said: <strong>"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."</strong> -
          Matthew 11:28</p>

        <p>Through Jesus Christ, God offers forgiveness, peace, and hope. His love reaches out to you today and always.
        </p>

        <p>"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish
          but have eternal life." - John 3:16</p>
      </section>

      <section class="invitation">
        <h2>Experience God's Love</h2>
        <p>No matter your past, God offers you a fresh start. His grace is a gift, freely given. All He asks is for you
          to open your heart to Him.</p>
        <p>Take a moment to reflect on His love for you. He promises: <strong>"Never will I leave you; never will I
            forsake you."</strong> - Hebrews 13:5</p>
      </section>

      <section class="salvation">
        <h2>Prayer of Salvation</h2>
        <div class="prayer">
          <p>If you want to accept Jesus as your Savior, you can pray this simple prayer:</p>
          <blockquote>
            "Dear Lord Jesus, I believe You are the Son of God. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I
            confess that I am a sinner and need Your forgiveness. Please come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior. I
            give You my life. Help me to live for You. In Jesus' name, Amen."
          </blockquote>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="encouragement">
        <h2>Walk in Faith</h2>
        <p>Jesus invites you to walk with Him daily. Through prayer, reading the Bible, and connecting with others who
          follow Him, you will experience His presence and grow in His love.</p>
        <p>Here is His promise: <strong>"I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."</strong> - John
          10:10</p>
